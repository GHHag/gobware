# gobware

Gobware is a software package implemented in GO, designed to simplify and enhance web development tasks. It provides a set of tools and functionalities to strengthen the security and access control of web applications.

Features
1. Web Token Security  
Gobware includes robust web token security mechanisms. Tokens are used to securely transmit information between parties as JSON objects, providing a stateless and secure way of handling user authentication and authorization. It enables secure and reliable user sessions without the need for server-side storage.

2. Access Control Lists (ACL)  
With built-in Access Control Lists, Gobware enables fine-grained control over user access to various resources and actions within the web application. Administrators can define access rules based on roles and permissions, ensuring that each user has appropriate access privileges.

3. Rate Limiting and Throttling  
Gobware offers rate limiting and throttling capabilities to control the rate of incoming requests from clients. This helps prevent abuse and potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks by restricting the number of requests per client within a specified time frame.

Getting Started
To start using Gobware in your GO web application, follow these simple steps:

Install Gobware using go get github.com/GHHag/gobware.

Import Gobware in your GO code: import "github.com/GHHag/gobware".

Utilize the various tools and functionalities of Gobware in your web application to enhance security and streamline development.
